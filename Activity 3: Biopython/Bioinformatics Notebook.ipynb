As you might know our DNA exists in pairs where A and T are together and G and C are together. A and T together form what is called a double bond whereas G and C form a triple bond. Naturally you can tell that G and C are a stronger bond, and as a result DNA that has more of these G and C nucleotides will make the DNA more stable.
